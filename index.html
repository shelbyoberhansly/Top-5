      Hello! and welcome to my very first basic html with a touch of css, about
      a couple of top fives here in NYC. Directly above this text that I have
      written I included a bunch of links taking you to a list of my top 5
      selections for those topics above. If at any time after clicking on a link
      if you want to return to this page just click the "back" link. Thanks for
      Viewing!
